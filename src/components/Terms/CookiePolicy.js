            We use cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
            technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to
            these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies
            enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the
            interests of visitors to our Site, and we refer to these as
            "performance" or "functionality" cookies. For example, we use
            cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or
            display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while
